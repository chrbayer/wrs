| RB-04 | Rebels attack garrison using standard combat (garrison gets `DEFENDER_BONUS`) | ✅ Done |
| RB-05 | Home systems are immune to rebellion | ✅ Done |
| RB-06 | Batteries reduce rebellion chance proportionally (1/MAX per level), only max batteries = immune | ✅ Done |

| SL-29 | Ring polygon containment is determined by ray-casting point-in-polygon test against the ordered polygon of ring system positions | ✅ Done |
| SL-30 | When a system is covered by multiple overlapping rings, the highest applicable bonus is used (not additive) | ✅ Done |
| SL-31 | Ring bonuses apply to Fighter and Bomber production only (effective rate = `production_rate × (1.0 + bonus)`, minimum `production_rate`). Upgrade and Battery Build are unaffected | ✅ Done |
| SL-32 | Ring bonuses are recalculated each turn before production | ✅ Done |
| SL-33 | Shield activation progress is processed at the start of end-of-round (before production) | ✅ Done |
| SL-34 | The "Activate Shield" button in the action panel shows current shield line count for the selected system (e.g., "Activate Shield (1/2)") | ✅ Done |
| SL-35 | The "Activate Shield" button is disabled when: batteries < `SHIELD_MIN_BATTERIES`, system already has `MAX_SHIELD_LINES_PER_SYSTEM` lines, or system is already in `SHIELD_ACTIVATE` mode | ✅ Done |
| SL-36 | Clicking "Activate Shield" enters partner selection mode. Clicking another owned system or station with valid conditions starts the activation. ESC cancels selection mode | ✅ Done |
| SL-36a | Shield activation supports mixed endpoints: system↔system, system↔station, station↔system, station↔station | ✅ Done |
| SL-37 | Partner validation checks: same owner, both have `SHIELD_MIN_BATTERIES` batteries, within `MAX_SYSTEM_DISTANCE`, neither at max lines, no duplicate line, neither already activating, structure limit not exceeded. Applies to both systems and stations | ✅ Done |

## Notes

- Requirements derived from German specification: `Spezifikation.md`
- **These requirements take precedence over the original specification.**
- Implementation language: GDScript (Godot 4.6)
- All core requirements from the original specification are complete.
- ~~Strikethrough requirements~~ are no longer valid (applies only to completed requirements).
- If a completed requirement needs to be changed, the old requirement shall be struck through and a new requirement shall be created.
- **Update 2026-02:** FUT-07 through FUT-17 implemented, adding bombers, defense batteries, production modes, conquest mechanics, scaled battery building, fog of war memory, and fighter morale.
- **Update 2026-02:** FUT-04a implemented, adding AI opponents with 5 selectable tactics. P-01a replaces P-01 to allow any human/AI mix.
- **Update 2026-02:** AI phases are now purely state-based (no turn numbers). Early: only neutrals visible (all tactics expand identically). Mid: neutrals + enemies (tactic-specific, but all expand to neutrals). Late: only enemies (full attack mode).
- **Update 2026-02:** Combat reports reworked: per-stage reports (C-17), attacker losses include battery kills (C-18), battery kills shown by F/B type (C-13b), zero counts omitted (C-19). Victory screen deferred until all reports shown (V-04).
- **Update 2026-02:** Fleet wave splitting (C-20): merged fleets exceeding MAX_FLEET_SIZE (40) are split into waves, each facing batteries independently. Counters the "deathball" strategy by making batteries more effective against large forces.
- **Update 2026-02:** Rebellion mechanic (FUT-18): asymmetric anti-snowball mechanic. Dominant players' unprotected systems may rebel, spawning neutral fighters. Home systems immune. Batteries reduce rebellion chance proportionally (20% per level), only max batteries (5) = fully immune.
- **Update 2026-02:** Shield lines (FUT-19): territorial defense via manually activated energy lines between battery-equipped systems. Attrition and blockade mechanics scale with shield density (inverse distance) and battery levels. Closed rings grant production bonuses. Battery support: connected neighbors contribute batteries × density × 0.5 to pre-combat fire. Bombers have 50% shield resistance. AI Fortress activates shields on frontier; all AI tactics avoid enemy shield crossings. 42 detailed requirements (SL-01 to SL-42), 11 new parameters. Production mode updated to PR-02b.
- **Update 2026-02:** Space stations (FUT-20): Material-based construction (24 FÄ, 3 rounds) anywhere in FoW visible area. Chain building from stars and operative stations. Batteries via material delivery (max 2). Visibility: invisible by default, detected via passive scan (stars: 200px, stations: 250px), fleet scan (size-dependent, `3 px/ship` above threshold of 5), or garrison (weapon signatures). Placement mode shows enemy scan radii as red circles, toggled via button. Combat: same as systems with batteries, destroyed on conquest. AI builds stations (Fortress/Economy/Balanced), delivers material, attacks enemy stations, builds batteries. 33 detailed requirements (SS-01 to SS-33), 12 new parameters. V-02 updated to V-02a (elimination includes stations).
- **Update 2026-02:** Rebellion dominance now uses multi-factor power score (weighted sum of system count, combat power in fighter equivalents, and total production rate) instead of pure system count. RB-01a/RB-02a replace RB-01/RB-02. REBELLION_CHANCE_PER_EXCESS replaced by REBELLION_CHANCE_PER_DOMINANCE (0.3) and three weight constants (REBELLION_DOMINANCE_WEIGHT_SYSTEMS=4.0, WEIGHT_COMBAT=0.1, WEIGHT_PRODUCTION=0.5).
- **Update 2026-02:** Station improvements: Stations now have auto-generated names ("S-1", "S-2") shown in labels, info text, and combat reports (SS-34, SS-14a). Station selection shows pulsing cyan halo like star selection (SS-16 update). Battery building consumes existing garrison immediately (SS-35). Shield activation supports mixed star/station endpoints (SL-36a, SS-36, SS-37). Enemy station battery display shows "?" when not in scan (SS-17a). Under-construction stations at build progress 2/3 provide partial scanning at 50% range (SS-26a). New parameters: STATION_PARTIAL_SCAN_MULTIPLIER (0.5), STATION_PARTIAL_SCAN_MIN_PROGRESS (2).
- **Update 2026-02:** Station destruction loss reporting: Surviving attackers after station destruction are lost (no return destination) and shown in combat report "SURVIVORS LOST" section (SS-13a, SS-38). Fleets arriving at destroyed stations generate a loss report for the fleet owner (SS-39).
- **Update 2026-02:** Graduated station visibility: Station detection now scales with garrison size instead of binary visible/invisible (SS-09a). Weapon signature range = `garrison_size × STATION_SIGNATURE_PER_SHIP` (10px/ship). Under-construction stations emit a base signature of `STATION_BUILD_SIGNATURE` (30px) once build progress ≥ 1. Passive scan and fleet scan add signature range to their detection radius. Own station info shows signature range. Placement mode shows build signature range. SS-10b, SS-17b, SS-18b replace previous versions. New requirements SS-40, SS-41. New parameters: STATION_SIGNATURE_PER_SHIP (10), STATION_BUILD_SIGNATURE (30).
- **Update 2026-02-18:** Rebellion defection & no defender bonus (FUT-18 extension): Garrison fighters defect proportionally to dominance excess (up to 50%, bombers loyal). Rebellion combat uses no defender bonus (rebels are locals). RB-15, RB-16 added. New parameters: REBELLION_DEFECTION_FACTOR (0.5), REBELLION_DEFECTION_MAX (0.5).
- **Update 2026-02-18:** Rebel status in UI (RB-17, UI-14b, UI-36): Rebel systems shown as "Rebel (+N/turn, -2/turn)" in status bar; hover adds reconquest cost hint. Normal neutral systems no longer show production rate. Fleet and standing order arrow labels now aligned beside the arrow based on angle (left/right/center depending on label side).
- **Update 2026-02-18:** Rebel system production (FUT-18 extension): Rebel systems (`is_rebel = true`) now actively produce fighters each turn with a decaying rate (`production_rate - rebel_production_decay`, floor = `MIN_PRODUCTION_RATE`). `rebel_production_decay` increases by `REBELLION_PRODUCTION_DECAY` (2) per turn. Normal neutral systems remain non-productive. Reconquering a rebel system costs an additional -1 production point as war damage (total = -2 vs. -1 for normal neutral systems). Combat report shows actual total production loss. RB-07 updated; new requirements RB-12, RB-13, RB-14. New parameter: `REBELLION_PRODUCTION_DECAY` (2).
